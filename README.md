# GBJAM-12

This repository holds the game project to be submitted at the [GBJAM-12](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-12), taking place between September 13th and the 23td 2024. Based on the rules, the development must not rely on any AI tools (including GitHub Co-pilot).

The project is built upon the Godot engine, **version 4.3**, available [here](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/download/4.3-stable/Godot_v4.3-stable_win64.exe.zip). We cannot used the .NET version to export the game into web support.

The most recent game's version can be played directly on [itch.io](https://charlesdouc.itch.io/cd-yesterday-at-823-pm-pumpys-spooky-worlds).
